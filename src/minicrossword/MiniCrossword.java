        // function that adds the word automatically to the list, but this
        // should never be used other than when you know you are adding a new
        // word, as the computation involves copying over an array to increase it.

        //can be returned quite quickly.  When checking for a general solution
        //in this set, a solution was found in 30 seconds with printing
        //a different initial word without printing took 1 second to finish
        //when a solution existed.  This was for 5x5

        //4 letter grids are much quicker.  4 seconds for both a blank
        //grid and a modified grid to finish, while a no solution grid was
        //able to check the entire tree in 30 seconds to return no solution;
        //another no solution grid took 2 min 51 sec to finish working
